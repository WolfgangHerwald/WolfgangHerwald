## Who Am I?
I am Wolfgang Herwald.  I am a data science with a diverse set of backgrounds including research in neural machine translation, and computational chemistry for which I have been published.  Currently I am interning on at Orange Silicon Valley working on the development of a one shot learning based NLT model which will translate the low resource Bambara language into french.  I also have strong developing interests in recommendation systems and I am currently developing an app which will be used to recommend dishes to people at local restaurants.  Former teacher and teacher-manager abroad with an exceptional ability to communicate complicated ideas in a concise and straightforward manner.  My influence as a teacher has also given me a passion to visualize my ideas in a way that provides additional clarity yet preserves a sense of personal aesthetic.

## I have profficiency with...
Python, SQL, Spark, Pandas, Numpy, Spark-SQL, Mongo-DB, and Sklearn.  Basic Machine Learning Models, Including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Basic Neural Networks, Clustering.  Using more advanced Machine Learning models such as transformers.  Data Preprocessing and Post-processing with a focus on text and tabular data.  </br>


## I am currently learning...
Natural Language Processing, currently focussed heavily on pre and post processing of AI translation; Deep Learning, Data Ethics, Product Analytics, Applications of Recommendation Systems, etc.
