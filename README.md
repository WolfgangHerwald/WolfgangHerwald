I am Wolfgang Herwald.  I am a data science with a diverse background.  Right now I am involved in neural machine translation research project at Orange Silicon Valley.  Here, I am developing a semi-supervised one shot learning based NMT model for the low-resource Bambara-French Language pair.  Due to it's low resource nature, the development of this model involves alot of additional pre and post processing which has led to some interesting corridors of research which I hope to discuss on my website later at some point.   My interests in machine learning extends beyond NMT however, as I have a strong interest in other NLP and general machine learning application, all of which will be applied in an upcoming app that I am developing alongside a group of classmates.  I have also in my time of the MSDS programs completed a variety of different mini projects which I will list below.  Most of these projects need to remain private on github but some of the more open-ended ones I have shared previews of on my website.

## I have profficiency with...
Python, SQL, Spark, Pandas, Numpy, Spark-SQL, Mongo-DB, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing  </br>

## I am currently learning...
Natural Language Processing, currently focussed heavily on pre and post processing of AI translation; Deep Learning, Data Ethics, Product Analytics, Applications of Recommendation Systems, etc.

## Before becoming a data scientist
In my undergraduate I was one of the first in the department to conduct computational chemistry research, which at the time meant using a variety of models very specific to the modelling of molecular orbitals.  This led me to a brief presentation on research surrounding computational chemistry to the department which included an application of the genetic algorithm which was likely the start of my interest in machine learning. I thought of becoming a computational chemist out of undergraduate but part of me felt that might be limiting which led me to a personal detour in my life where I went abroad to teach in Vietnam.  My influence as a former teacher abroad has also given me a much more well-rounded perspective on life which has taught me how to communicate and visualize my ideas in a way that allows people to understand my intention but also has an element of aesthetic.
